# An-Introduction-to-Random-Walks
Developed a comprehensive project exploring random walk theory, integrating theoretical mathematical concepts with practical Python simulations. Analyzed various random walk models, implemented simulations to visualize behavior over time, and interpreted results to demonstrate key statistical properties.
